This is the main interaction point for a user or bot with Thoth. The API
itself exposes endpoints that are well documented using Swagger. There are
exposed only endpoints that can be useful for a user in some way. Some
functionality of Thoth is orchestrated by CronJobs or internal triggered and
are not directly exposed to a user (Thoth is supposed to be a self-living
system).

If you would like to programmatically access this API service, the preferred
way for interaction is the autogenerated swagger-client available in the
`Thamos repository <https://github.com/thoth-station/thamos>` (see
autogenerated documentation for more info). You can be also ensured that this
client is kept up2date respecting the current API state.

Installation and deployment
###########################

The service is built using OpenShift Source-to-Image and deployed
automatically with Thoth's deployment playbooks available in the `core
repository <https://github.com/thoth-station/core`_.
